crisisvolunteer
===============

An app for volunteers in crisis response. Share your skills, display your badges, get alerts about current volunteer needs.


The goal of this app is to have a resource for people who do volunteer work in crisis situations. It combines access to the Hackaid open crisis badges and a way for organizations to share information about current volunteer needs in a given geographic area.

Pages:
     Profile -- Collects information for badge retrieval from Mozilla's backpack and information about the volunteer's skills to help target volunteer opportunities for the user.
     Badges -- A display page with badges from the Mozilla backpack to show past experience, proven skills, etc
     Volunteer Opportunities -- Will connect to an application the Geeks Without Bounds website to provide information about current volunteer requests that fit the user.
     
     
Additional ideas for future development:
      User can share volunteer opportunities to Facebook and other social media to spread the word among friends.
      User can share status with new badges they receive to Facebook/other social media.
      Connect to existing crisis mapping to show locations around the world where crisis volunteers are in action (general, not specific. ie so you can see crises that aren't on your local news.)
